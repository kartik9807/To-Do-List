📝 To-Do List Application built using **Vanilla JavaScript**, focusing on proper **state management**, **event delegation**, and **data-driven UI rendering**.

The app maintains a single source of truth for tasks, supports task creation, editing, deletion, and completion tracking, and persists data using **localStorage** so no data is lost on refresh. UI is dynamically re-rendered based on application state, ensuring consistent behavior without DOM-driven bugs.

### Key Features
- Add, edit, delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed with progress tracking
- Dynamic UI rendering from state
- Event delegation for efficient event handling
- localStorage persistence
- Duplicate and empty task validation
- Progress indicator with completion ratio

### Concepts Practiced
- State-driven UI architecture
- Event bubbling & delegation
- DOM re-render safety
- Separation of data and UI
- Defensive JavaScript coding patterns

This project was built to strengthen frontend fundamentals and prepare for frameworks like React.
